# termtime

As with many of my projects this started as a bit of investigation, desire to learn and often a sense of nostalgia (smile)

My programming career started 30 years ago when I was programming text based window apps for Unix (pre-dating Linux) on a curses-style, home grown library of C code that provided a user interface to COBOL business applications.
My first goal in that role was to bring the company I was working for kicking and screaming into the 90s with a Windows interface to things. I succeeded but left that company because it was the early days of the web and I had other ambitions - but that's another story.

Nowadays i'm a complete cloud native, and embracing the command line once again. For several years really i've been back in the command line, ensuring pipelines and workflows can do the work that I don't want to do repetitively. In recent years i've seen a number of apps using TUI instead of GUI so thought "why not add another tool to my toolbox in case I ever want to build my own terminal based app using my programming language of choice right now - Go!".

I know there are many established frameworks out there - this isn't about being the first, or the best, it's just for fun.
